# The goal

- Use MDN, w3schools, chatGPT, whatever float your boat to help you understand how those functions work.
- Do a quick explaination of each function
- Provide a simple example for each so we can see it's implementation.
- Write you examples in a JavaScript file linked to an html page, you should use Chrome to open the html page. (Open the dev tools so we can see the console!)
